# Data-Mining-Techniques-Applied-to-Airline-Delay-and-Iris-Datasets

This project was developed as part of the Data Mining course and focuses on
applying various data analysis and machine learning techniques to real-world
datasets. The study involves both supervised learning and clustering methods,
implemented in Python and R:

* Performing univariate and multivariate analysis on the Airlines Delay dataset to identify key trends and patterns
* Extracting association rules to uncover relationships within the dataset
* Implementing supervised classification, including data preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, model training, and evaluation
* Applying multiple classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Na√Øve Bayes, k-NN, Neural Networks, and SVM
* Conducting clustering analysis on the Iris dataset, using linkage metrics, k-Means, Expectation-Maximization (EM), and DBSCAN
* Performing parameter tuning to optimize the clustering results
